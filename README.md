# SafeUrb

**SafeUrb** is an application that allows users to report events such as assaults and robberies 
from the location of the user who reports with the objective of identifying the areas where these 
situations occur. 

Through this, the application can also serve as a guide, since people can see which are the most 
vulnerable areas through the statistics that it offers through an algorithm.
